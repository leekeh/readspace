# ReadSpace

ReadSpace is a Progressive Web App that allows you to read texts in a personalized, distraction-free environment. It is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Why not React/Vue/Svelte/[insert framework]?

Nowadays, frontend development is dominated by frameworks, the one succeeding the other in rapid succession. I wanted to learn how to use web APIs and access the browser's full capabilities, instead of using abstraction layers. The same goes for the usage of libraries, although I took some samples from open-source projects. Finally, I think that it is nice to ship code that does not need to compile. It is more of an idealism than something that benefits the users, but I like the idea of shipping code that is as close to the source as possible. For the production build, I do use minification to increase performance.
