# About

This Storybook documents and showcases the components used for the Readspace project.

`Readspace` is a web application that allows users to read documents. It is an ereader in the browser. It is built with Svelte and accepts various document formats. To read more about it, check out [the project on Github](https://github.com/leekeh/readspace).

A key feature of Readspace is the ability to change the appearance of the document. This is done by changing the theme. The theme is a set of styles that are applied to the document. The user can choose from a set of predefined themes or create their own.

For this storybook, this means that the rendering of the components is highly dependent on the theme selected. Use the toolbar at the top to change the theme.
